# Elves Are Fun

## Challenge Description

Ninaad, a script kiddie created his first C program but he is well aware about buffer overflow and wants to abuse it, can you help him in the same by finding out from where the BSS stack starts?

Also, his favorite number is 1140, let him know what's stored there.

Flag Format: `hacks{last 4 hex digits of value+nameintable}`. Use the symbol `+` in the flag.

## Provided Files

- [a.out](<files/a.out>)

## Solution Walkthrough

### Step 1: Examine the Binary with Ghidra

To analyze the provided binary file `a.out`, I used Ghidra, a powerful reverse engineering tool.

1. **Open the File in Ghidra**
   First, open the `a.out` file in Ghidra and analyze the disassembly.

2. **Navigate to .bss Section**
   In the program tree, navigate to the `.bss` section. The `.bss` section is where uninitialized variables are stored, and in this case, we need to find the starting address of the BSS stack.

   Upon inspecting the `.bss` section, we found that it starts at the address `00104010`.

   We now have part of the flag: `hacks{4010+`.
 

### Step 2: Investigate the Symbol Table

Next, we need to explore the symbol table to find an address related to Ninaad's favorite number, 1140.

1. **Navigate to Symbol Table**
   In Ghidra, go to the symbol table and inspect the addresses of the symbols.

2. **Find Symbol Address Ending with 1140**
   In the symbol table, I found an interesting symbol whose address ends with `1140`. The symbol associated with this address is `frame_dummy`.
    
   This leads us to the second part of the flag: `frame_dummy`.

### Step 3: Construct the Flag

Combining both parts, the final flag is: `hacks{4010+frame_dummy}`
