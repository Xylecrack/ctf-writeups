Step 1: Using dcode.fr to decode rail-fence cipher. Looks like some meaningful sentence without space

```plaintext
- I AM HOME TO ANCIENT LINES ETCHED IN THE SAND
- ONE REVEALS A FELINE LOUNGING SO GRAND
- WITH SECRETS IN DESERTS AND ANDES SO HIGH
- GUESS MY NAME WHERE CONDORS FLY
- WHAT COUNTRY AM I
```

Step 2: `- WHAT COUNTRY AM I`. The answer for that riddle Is Peru => hacks{peru}

### Flag
