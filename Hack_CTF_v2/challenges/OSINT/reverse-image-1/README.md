## Solution Walkthrough

### Step 1: Analyze the Image

The challenge provides an image file `osint1.jpg`. To solve it, we need to gather information about the location depicted in the image.

### Step 2: Identify Clues in the Image

Upon inspecting the image, I noticed a store named "Ritual" visible in the image. This is a clue that could help us narrow down the train station location.

### Step 3: Perform OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

Next, I cross-checked the store "Ritual" with train stations in the ÃŽle-de-France region (which includes Paris and surrounding areas). After some research, I found that "Ritual" is associated with the Gare de l'Est train station.

### Step 4: Construct the Flag

`hacks{Gare_de_l'Est}`
