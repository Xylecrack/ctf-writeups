Title: Credit Card Conundrum

Description: A list of 100 possible credit card numbers has been intercepted, but only one of them is valid. The valid number, however, was encoded to keep it hidden from prying eyes.

Your mission:

Decode each credit card number to reveal its original form.
Identify the valid credit card number from the decoded list using a standard verification method.
Finally, submit the original, unencoded number as the flag.

Flag Format: flag{xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx}

Hints:

Hint 1: Decode the numbers by applying a two-stage decryption process.
Hint 2: After decoding, use a common verification method for credit card numbers to locate the valid one.
